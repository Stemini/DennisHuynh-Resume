        <p class="lead mb-4">My interest and love for teaching all started in my first year of college. I was asked by a lead pastor at the church I attend to become a leader in our youth program known as Living Fire. At first I was hesitant, having been in the program before, I knew how large and intimidating the group would be. The students were varied, having come from many different economic and social backgrounds. Nevertheless, I agreed as I had already had an interest in teaching prior and because this was the same community that fostered my growth in the past. For the first 6 months, I mainly shadowed, listening into both meetings and lessons. During this time, I observed and noted the different teaching strategies and lessons, which later became the foundation for my own techniques. I then began creating lesson plans for the students; this was done with the collaboration of other leaders of the group. Following, I began teaching to the 40+ students attending a night. Witnessing the studentsâ€™ growth in both knowledge and faith validated my work and pushed me to be better. 
My passion for teaching developed even further once I joined UCRâ€™s SMI Teaching program. There, I met Leslie and was suggested to join the Education 03 class that was being offered. A requirement of the class was the inclusion of field work hours, meaning I had to observe a real classroom. Before joining this class, I had always seen the classroom as a place of order. My alma mater was always peaceful, rarely with any disruptions. My assigned classroom was completely different. I quickly became aware of the stark differences between classrooms and schools. While orderly at most times due to the teacherâ€™s stoic nature, I saw a unique opportunity to learn from the rare disorderly instances. After some time, my assigned teacher, David Susuras, allowed me to create my own lesson plan for his chemistry class. This lesson, although far from perfect, was my first introduction in teaching an actual science course. 
Through all this, I have honed and evaluated my skills and love for the subject of teaching and have found it to be the profession I want to pursue.
